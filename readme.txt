== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What about Google? =

This plugin targets only a browser by `user-agent` most of the spiders, indexers and bots (like WhatsApp/telegram previews, Facebook share preview, etc.) are not redirected to the cookie wall. This way they can index what they want without interruption.
